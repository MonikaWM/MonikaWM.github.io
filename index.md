#  Welcome to my page, enjoy it!

Hi!
My name is Monika and I come from Poland. I'm Polish but I treat myself like a citizen of the World. Universe is my home. I'm almost 30 years old and I live in Dęblin, with my son, husband and 3 rats. Yes, rats - I love them! :) I like cycling and reading books - criminals (scandinavian are the best ones), reportages, (auto)biographies, something about meditation and mindfluence - a spiritual development.

Now, I'm process engineer in the production of welded structures. My main role is do the workshop drawings. Before this vacancy I used to work as a Assistant to Designer in electrical and telecom industries. I did a lot of documentation and projects in my life (e.g. executive project, civil engineering design - mainly electrical and telecom).


## Fun fact from my past.

I lived in Iceland for almost 2 years. I have been working in Becromal Iceland ehf (now: TDK foil Iceland ehf) as Laboratory Technician and Slitting Clerk. My son was born there and after giving a birth, togeter with husband, we decided to come back Poland and raise here our baby boy.
